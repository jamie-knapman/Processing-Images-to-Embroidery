Initial setup:
-Choosing the correct IDE: Pycharm
    ->Seamless git integration for unloading files as the project progresses.
    ->Virtual Environment to simplify dependency handling when using many libraries.
    ->GUI designer aid for making image upload/previews
-Choosing the right UI framework: PyQt
    ->High variety of widgets(buttons, menus etc) for customizability

^^Both resource heavy but overall better than things like Spyder and Tkinter

Created a Skeleton UI draft: Dev/Ui_Draft
