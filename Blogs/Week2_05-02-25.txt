Started the week by revising what i already know about openCV as well as some new concepts for later use in my program
implemented some edge detection algorithms (canny & contour) in a separate project (FirstCanny.png)
Added file uploads and said edge detection into the main UI (UploadTest1(-4).png)
Combined both canny edge detection and contours to produce refined images for embroidery(emb.png) ONLY WORKS FOR EASY IMAGES.
Final addition this week was adding some pyembroidery functionality to make dst files

Helpful picture of Moe for edge complexity while excluding noise :) (Test.png)

Submitted and got feedback on UI-Draft

For next week:
Fix sizing issue on image outputs
Write to .pes instead of .dst
Experiment with Embroidery machine (when fixed)
Write a section about software engineering techniques (Chapter for final report)
Gain a proof of concept embroider (any design)
Research shading of images
Research some background subtraction for later in project
