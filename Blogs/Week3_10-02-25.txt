---ADJUSTMENT TO BLOG DATES---
->Blogs will now be dates as the monday commencing the current work week e.g. this blog is for the 10th-17th of feb.
  This is to keep all weeks starting at the same time.

---Tasks completed---
->Fixed sizing issue by adding weights on the contour coordinates expanding the design such that it can be embroidered properly.
->Made the program write to .pes instead of .dst so the files are more "native" to the machine used.
->Gained a Minimum working example of embroidery using the program (see Panda.jpeg & Ghost.jpeg).
->Adding more functionality to embroidery by building on the POC work (Prototype2.py). (Testing needed)
    ->Added jump stitching to contour to prevent constant machine restarts.
    ->Added custom thresh holding to adjust images contours manually/
    ->Added writeable functionality for manual edge detection.

---Tasks ongoing/Being done as of writing---
->Researching image shading
->Test prototype2.py

---Tasks carried over---
->Write a section about software engineering techniques (Chapter for final report)
->Research some background subtraction for later in project

---New Tasks---
If prototype2.py doesn't work then getting it working will take priority.
Add and test shading of images.
